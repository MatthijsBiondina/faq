# Turning an Existing Directory into a GitHub Repository on Ubuntu 20.04

This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to turn an existing directory on Ubuntu 20.04 into a GitHub repository using SSH for secure authentication.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Git installed on your Ubuntu system
- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of terminal and command line operations

## Step 1: Install Git

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

Configure your Git user (replace `Your Name` and `your.email@example.com` with your actual name and email):


git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"


## Step 2: Generate SSH Key Pair

Generate your SSH key pair:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

Press **Enter** to accept the default file location. Set a passphrase when prompted for enhanced security (optional).

## Step 3: Add SSH Key to SSH Agent

Ensure the ssh-agent is running:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## Step 4: Add SSH Public Key to GitHub

Copy your SSH public key to the clipboard:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | xclip -selection clipboard
```

If `xclip` is not installed, use `sudo apt install xclip` to install it. Then, log into your GitHub account:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **SSH and GPG keys** > **New SSH key**
2. Provide a title, paste your key, and click **Add SSH key**

## Step 5: Initialize Your Local Repository

Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

Initialize the directory as a Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

## Step 6: Prepare and Commit Your Files

Add all files to the staging area:

```bash
git add .
```

Commit the files:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## Step 7: Create a GitHub Repository

Log into GitHub and create a new repository at [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new). Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or License.

## Step 8: Link Your Local Repository to GitHub

Copy the SSH URL from your GitHub repository, which looks like this: `git@github.com:username/repository.git`.

Link your local repository to the GitHub repository:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
```

## Step 9: Push Your Code to GitHub

Push your code:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

Replace `master` with `main` if your default branch is named `main`. If prompted, enter your passphrase.

## Conclusion

Your local directory is now a GitHub repository with all changes pushed to GitHub using SSH for secure authentication. You can now continue to manage your project through Git commands.
```

## Additional Notes

- **Checking remote URLs**: `git remote -v` shows the URLs that Git has stored for the shortcut names.
- **Changing remote URLs**: Use `git remote set-url origin new.git.url/here` if you need to change the repository's remote URL.
- **Pulling changes from GitHub**: Use `git pull origin master` to merge changes from the remote branch to your local branch.
- **Cloning another repository**: Use `git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git` for cloning repositories using SSH.
