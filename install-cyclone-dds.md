Setting up Eclipse Cyclone DDS on a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu 20.04 involves ensuring that you have all the necessary prerequisites installed. Below are the detailed steps to check and install these prerequisites:

### 1. Update Your System

First, make sure your system package list and the system itself are up-to-date:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### 2. Install C Compiler and Related Tools

Cyclone DDS requires a C compiler (GCC), CMake, and potentially other build tools. Install these along with GIT for version control:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake git -y
```

- **build-essential**: Installs GCC and other essential compilers and libraries.
- **cmake**: A system that manages the build process in an operating system and in a compiler-independent manner.
- **git**: Version control system used to manage the Cyclone DDS source code.

### 3. Install OpenSSL (Optional)

OpenSSL is optional unless you require TLS/TCP support and security features. Install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install openssl libssl-dev -y
```

- **openssl**: The basic binary for running OpenSSL.
- **libssl-dev**: Development libraries for compiling applications that use OpenSSL.

### 4. Install Eclipse Iceoryx (Optional)

Eclipse Iceoryx provides mechanisms for zero-copy inter-process-communication. It is optional and not required to run Cyclone DDS. However, if desired, you might need to build it from source as packages may not be readily available for Raspberry Pi. Check the [Eclipse Iceoryx GitHub](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx) page for building instructions.

### 5. Install Bison (Optional)

Bison is a general-purpose parser generator. If you plan to modify or develop parsers within Cyclone DDS, install Bison with:

```bash
sudo apt install bison -y
```

### 6. Check Installation of Prerequisites

After installation, you can verify the versions installed (which can be helpful for troubleshooting):

```bash
gcc --version
cmake --version
git --version
openssl version
bison --version
```

Each command should return the version of the respective tool installed, confirming their presence on your system.

### 7. Clone Cyclone DDS Repository

Once all prerequisites are installed, you can clone the Cyclone DDS repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds.git
cd cyclonedds
```

### 8. Proceed with Cyclone DDS Installation

Create a build directory and proceed with the configuration:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-location> ..
cmake --build .
```

Replace `<install-location>` with the directory where you want Cyclone DDS installed (e.g., `/usr/local`).

### 9. Install Cyclone DDS

To install Cyclone DDS on your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
sudo cmake --build . --target install
```

This command installs Cyclone DDS to the directory specified earlier.

### Conclusion

You now have all the prerequisites installed on your Raspberry Pi for developing with Eclipse Cyclone DDS. You can begin setting up your development environment, compiling, and running DDS applications. If you encounter issues, consider verifying each component's installation, checking log files, or consulting documentation specific to each tool.
